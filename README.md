# 💥 Where is my CSS?

## 😱 Oh NO! We've accidentally deleted the CSS code from our login page.

Luckily, we've recovered the `<body>` of our login page:

### 🛠️ How are we going to do it?

We will use **CSS3** to style the form, applying:
- Layout and positioning
- Colors and backgrounds
- Fonts and typography
- Spacing (margins, paddings)
- Responsive design techniques

**Note:** Modifying the HTML is **not allowed**—we will only add styles via CSS.
